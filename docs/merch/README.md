 # Whole Donuts Merch Platform

Sponsor merchandise operations built with a Next.js dashboard, Express API, PostgreSQL, Shopify, and Printful fulfillment. Shopify is the checkout and order system of record; PostgreSQL stores Whole Donuts sponsor, referral, and operational data.

## Production architecture

```text
https://merch.example.com       Next.js dashboard
             |
https://merch-api.example.com   Express API, Shopify webhooks, Printful status
             |
           private managed PostgreSQL
```

Deploy the dashboard and API as separate managed HTTPS services on one provider with managed PostgreSQL. The database must remain private to the provider network. Use [`infra/docker/docker-compose.production.example.yml`](../../infra/docker/docker-compose.production.example.yml) only as a service definition; it intentionally does not provision a database, TLS endpoint, reverse proxy, or secrets.

Read [the deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) before creating a production service. It includes the complete environment-value matrix, release procedure, and rollback steps.

## Local development

1. Copy `apps/merch/api/.env.example` to `apps/merch/api/.env` and replace the local database value.
2. Run `npm ci` in both `apps/merch/api/` and `apps/merch/web/`.
3. Create the local PostgreSQL database, then run `npm run migrate` from `apps/merch/api/`.
4. Start `npm run dev` from both service directories.
5. Open `http://localhost:3000`; the API health endpoint is `http://localhost:3001/health`.

The frontend reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`. It is public build-time configuration, never a secret. The backend reads secrets only from its runtime environment.

## Service commands

| Directory | Command | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/merch/api/` | `npm start` | Run the Express API |
| `apps/merch/api/` | `npm run migrate` | Apply tracked forward-only migrations |
| `apps/merch/api/` | `npm run refresh-sponsor-metrics` | Run the scheduled metric refresh once |
| `apps/merch/api/` | `npm test` | Test webhook HMAC verification |
| `apps/merch/web/` | `npm run build` | Build the production dashboard |

Run the metric refresh from one provider scheduler, not from each API instance.

## Commerce integration

- [Shopify setup](SHOPIFY_SETUP.md) covers the custom app, scopes, verified webhook topics, and callback URL.
- [Printful setup](PRINTFUL_SETUP.md) covers the Shopify fulfillment connection and server-side API token.
- `POST /api/orders/webhook/shopify` accepts only configured topics with a valid Shopify HMAC and webhook delivery ID. Replayed deliveries are acknowledged without reprocessing.
- `GET /api/printful/status` is an operator-only connectivity check. Do not expose integration tokens to the frontend.

## Security boundary

Browser sessions use HttpOnly, Secure production cookies; the API enforces CSRF validation for cookie-authenticated mutations. Sponsor access remains scoped to the authenticated sponsor. Operator-only routes require the separate `X-Operator-Key` credential, whose value must be stored in the provider secret manager and sent only by trusted operations tooling.

Client-created dashboard orders are unverified records: their prices come from the
server catalog and they cannot set provider order IDs, referral attribution,
contribution, tier, or rewards. Sponsor registration always starts with zero
contribution and the bronze defaults. Only an HMAC-verified Shopify
`orders/create` or `orders/updated` webhook with `financial_status: paid` can
create a referral conversion and contribution update.
